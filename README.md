I created this simple frontend because I hate using Microsoft Word.  
So I made myself a very simplistic HTML & CSS way of making my own document.  
This application's PDF output was used for my final internship report.

Basically, I solved a problem I had in a quick 'n' dirty way.

Things I would change if I had more time:  
Make an actual Postgres database or Solidity SmartContract to host the string-based data.  
Add proper URL-based paging in stead of using localStorage.  
Document my code properly.

Time spent on this project: 1 weekend with some tweaks the weeks after. My guess is I spent 22 hours on this.  
Now that I've finished my internship I believe I should be a LOT faster and with better quality code. Like the URL based paging.  
My templates would cut down multiple hours alone, I think.
